A matching is a function $\mu:I\to S\cup \{\varnothing\}$  
A matching $\mu$ is individually rational if $\mu(i)\succsim_i\varnothing$ for every $i\in I$.  
A tentative student placement is a correspondence $\mu:I\Rarr S\cup \{\varnothing\}$  
A matching $\mu$ eliminates justified envy if, when $\mu(j)\succsim_i \mu(i)$, let $t(\mu(j))=c_1$, then it implies that $e^{i}_{c_1}\le e^{j}_{c_1}$. A matching which eliminates justified envy is called fair.  
A matching $\mu$ is non-wasteful if $s\succsim_i \mu(i)\implies q^{slot}_s=0$  
A matching $\nu$ is Pareto dominates a mathcing $\mu$ if no student prefers $\mu$ to $\nu$ and there is at least one student prefers $\nu$ to $\nu$. It means that for every $i\in I$, $\nu(i)\succsim_i\mu(i)$ and for at least a $j\in I$, $\nu(j)\succ_j\mu(j)$. If a matching $\mu$, there isn't any matching $\nu$ Pareto dominates it, then it is called a Pereto effficient matching.


:::

It is obvious that if a mathcing is a Pareto efficient matching, then it is indivitially rational and non-wasteful.


::: {.lemma  name=""}

A matching $\mu$ is fair iff there exists a list of base scores $(e_s)=(e_{s_1},e_{s_2},\ldots)$ s.t. for all $i\in I$ and $s \in S$ satisfy:
- $\mu(i)=s\implies e^{i}_{t(s)}\ge e_s$
- $e^{i}_{t(s)}\ge e_s\implies  \mu(i)\succsim_i s$

:::

::: {.proof}

Let $\mu$ be a fair matching. For each $s \in S$, let $e_s=\min_{i \in \mu^{-1}(s)}e^{i}_{t(s)}$, then let $(e_s)=(e_{s_1},e_{s_2},\ldots)$. The first condition is hold by the definition. Assume that the second condistion is not hold, that means there is a $s \in S$ and $i\in I$ with $e^{i}_{t(s)}\ge e_s$ and $s\succ_i\mu(i)$. By the construction of $e_s$, $s\succ_i\mu(i)$ implies that there is at least a $j\in I$ with $e^{j}_{t(s)}\lt e^{i}_{t(s)}$ which leads to a contradiction of the fairness.  
For the converse, let $\mu$ be a matching and $(e_s)=(e_{s_1},e_{s_2},\ldots)$ is a base score vector which satisfies those two conditions. Give $i,j\in I$ and $\mu(j)=s \in S$ and $s\succ_i \mu(i)$, then $e^{i}_{t(s)}\lt e_s$ by the second condition, and $e^{j}_{t(s)}\ge e_s$, so $e^{i}_{t(s)}\le e^{j}_{t(s)}$ which means the fairness.

:::

The above lemma shows that if we can find a base score s.t. satisfies above conditions, then the matching in the conditions is a fair matching.

::: {.theorem  name=""}

A school placement matching eliminates justified envy and is non-wasteful and individually rational iff the matching is stable in the associated colledge admissions problem. That means, there is an isomorphism with stable college admissions.

::: {.definition  name="Associated college admissions problem"}

- A finite school set $S$ 
- A finite students set $I$ 
- A preference of school for each schools  $\succsim_s$ and for each school $s \in S$, and for two students $i,j\in I$, $i\succsim_s j$ iff $e^{i}_{t(s)}\ge e^{j}_{t(s)}$. And for any  $s \in S$, any students $i\in I$,  $i\succsim_s \varnothing$.
- A matching $\mu$ which is a function $\mu:I\to S$.
- A quota vector $(q_s)$ which is the quota of each $s \in S$.

A student-school pair is $(i,s)\in I\times S$ blocks a mathcing $\mu$ if $s\succ_i\mu(i)$ and  $\lvert \mu^{-1}(s) \rvert\lt q_s$ or $s\succ_i\mu(i)$ with $i\succ_s j$ for some $j\in \mu^{-1}(s)$.  
A matching is stable if it is individually rational and blocks with no student-school pair where individually rational means that whether for any $i\in I$, any  $s \in S$, $s\succ_i\varnothing$ and $i\succ_s\varnothing$.

A matching is individually rational, fair, and non-wasteful for a student placement problem iff it is stable for its associated college admissions problem.

:::

From above lemma, it is easy to get that Pareto efficiency implies individual ratinonality and non-wastefulness in placement problem.


::: {.definition  name="Formal Description of the Porblem and Algorithm"}

- A student placing problem is $(I,S,(\succ_i),(\succ_s),q)$ where $(\succ_s)$ is determined by $e^{i}_{t(s)}$ and $I,S$ is determined before the algorithm, so a students placing problem is $((\succ_i),(e^{i}),(q_s))$. Then let $\mu^{S}((\succ_i),(e^{i}),(q_s))$ be a student optimal stable matching and $\mu^{C}((\succ_i),(e^{i}),(q_s))$ be the school's.
- For multi-category serial dictatorship, we denote the preference list $(\succ_i)^{k}$ be the preference list befor k-step iteration and $(\succ_i)=(\succ_i)^{1}$.
- Let the $\mathcal{M}((\succ_i),(e^{i}),(q_s))$ be the set of all the stable matchings of the problem $((\succ_i),(e^{i}),(q_s))$

:::

::: {.theorem  name=""}

The multi-category serial dictatorship and school-DA algorithm are equivalent.

:::

::: {.proof}

Consider the initial problem $((\succ_i),(e^{i}),(q_s))$ and the list of problems generated by MCSD, $((\succ_i)^{\alpha},(e^{i}),(q_s))$ where $\alpha=1,2,3,\ldots,n$.  
First we need to prove that $\mathcal{M}((\succ_i)^{\alpha},(e^{i}),(q_s))=\mathcal{M}((\succ_i)^{\alpha+1},(e^{i}),(q_s))$.  
Let $\mu\in \mathcal{M}((\succ_i)^{\alpha},(e^{i}),(q_s))$, then as the description of $((\succ_i)^{\alpha+1},(e^{i}),(q_s))$, $\mu$ must be individually rational in  $((\succ_i)^{\alpha+1},(e^{i}),(q_s))$.  
$$ \ldots $$
Then to show that $\{\mu^{C}((\succ_i)^{n+1},(e^{i}),(q_s))\}=\mathcal{M}((\succ_i)^{n},(e^{i}),(q_s))$ by the structure of perference list of $((\succ_i)^{n},(e^{i}),(q_s))$.  
$$ \ldots $$
Then we prove the equivalence.
