A strategic game consists of:
- A finite set $N$ which is the set of players
- For each player $i\in N$ a non-empty set $A_i$ which is the actions available to player $i$ 
- For each player $i\in N$ a preference relation $\succsim_i$ on $A=\times_{j\in N}A_j$ which is the preference relation of player $i$.

:::

The preference relation describe a order of the joint action space of a player.


::: {.definition  name="Payoff Functions"}

A payoff function of player $i$ is defined as $u_i:A\to \R$ where $A=\times_{j\in N}A_j$. Payoff functions usually hold the relations that $u_i(a)\ge u_i(b)\implies a\succsim_i b$.

::: {.definition nash name="Nash Equilibrium"}

A Nash equilibrium of a strategic game $(N,(A_i),(\succsim_i))$ is a profile $a^{*}\in A$ with the property that for every $i\in N$, we have:

$$ (a_{-i}^{*},a_i^{*})\succsim_i(a_{-i}^{*},a_i) $$
for every $a_i\in A_i$.  
Depend on the defination of nash equilibrium, we give the def of the best actions with giving $a_{-i}$ :

$$ B_i(a_{-i})=\{a_i\in A_i:(a_{-i},a_i)\succsim_i(a_{-i},a_i')\text{, for every }a_i'\in A_i\} $$
Now the nash equilibrium can be rewritten as:

$$ (a_i^{*})\in A:a_i^{*}\in B_i(a_{-i}^{*}) $$
for every $i\in N$.

::: {.definition  name="Strictly Competitive Game"}

A strategic game $(\{1,2\},(A_i),(\succsim_i))$ is a strictly competitive game if for any $a\in A$ and $b\in A$, we have $a\succsim_1 b$ iff $b\succsim_2a$.  

:::

Notice that $a,b\in A$ means both $a,b$ is a tuple that contains some action of player 1 and some action of player 2.
