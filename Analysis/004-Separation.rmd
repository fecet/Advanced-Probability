## Separation

```{definition, T0, name=""}
Space $(\Omega,\tau)$ is said to be $T_0$ or **kolmogorov** if for every pair $(x,y)\in \Omega^2$, either there exist $N\in \mathcal{N}(x)$ s.t. $y\notin N$ or $N\in \mathcal{N}(y)$ s.t. $x\notin N$.
```

```{lemma, , name=""}
$\tau$ isn't $T_0$ iff there exist pair $(x,y)$, s.t:

1. $\mathcal{N}(x)=\mathcal{N}(y)$.
2. $\overline{\{x\}}=\overline{\{y\}}$.

```

```{proof}
1 If every $N\in \mathcal{N}(x)$ contains $y$, then $N\in \mathcal{N}(y)\implies \mathcal{N}(x)\subset \mathcal{N}(y)$, thus $\mathcal{N}(x)=\mathcal{N}(y)$.

2 If some point $a\in \overline{\{x\}}$, then every $N\in \mathcal{N}(a)$ also is neighborhood of $x$ and thus neighborhood of $y$, hence $a\in \overline{\{y\}}$.

```

```{definition, T1, name=""}
Space $(\Omega,\tau)$ is said to be $T_1$ or **Frechet** if for every pair $(x,y)\in \Omega^2$,there exist $N\in \mathcal{N}(x)$ s.t. $y\notin N$ and $N\in \mathcal{N}(y)$ s.t. $x\notin N$.
```

```{theorem, , name=""}
Following statements are equivalent:

1. $\tau$ is $T_1$.
2. Singetons are closed.
3. $\ker \mathcal{N}(x)=\{x\}$ holds for any $x\in \Omega$.

```


```{proof}
$1\implies 2$ If there exist a singeton $\{x\}$ not closed, there is $y\in \overline{\{x\}}$, hence every neighborhood of $y$ contains $x$, contradiction.

$2\implies 3$ Suppose $\ker \mathcal{N}(x)$ contains $y$ diifer $x$, that implies any neighborhood of $x$ contains $y$ and contradict $2$.

$3\implies 1$ is straightforward.
```

```{lemma, , name=""}
Suppose $(\Omega,\tau)$ with a finite base is $T_1$, then $\Omega$ is finite and $\tau$ is discrete.
```




```{definition, hausdorff, name=""}
A topology $(\Omega,\tau)$ is $T_2$, or **Hausdorff** or **separated** if every pair $(x,y)\in \Omega^2$, there exist $U\in \mathcal{N(x)}$ and $V\in \mathcal{N(y)}$ s.t. $U\cap V=\emptyset$.
```

```{theorem, t2equiv, name=""}
Following statements are equivalent:

1. $\tau$ is $T_2$.
2. Intersection of family of closed neighborhoods of $x$ is $x$.
3. If a filter(net) converges to some point $x$, then $\mathop{\text{Adh}}_{}(\mathcal{F})=\{x\}$
3. Every net(filter) converges to at most one point.

```

```{proof}

$1\implies 2$ For any pair $(x,y)$, by definition, there is $y\notin \overline{U}$, hence intersection of family of closed neighborhoods of $x$ can only contains $x$.

$2\implies 3$ follows from a point adherent to a filter converges to $x$ must be in every closed neighborhood of $x$.

$3\implies 4$ is clearly.

$4\implies 1$
If there is a net $x.$ converges to both $x$ and $y$, then $\mathcal{N}(x)\subset \mathcal{F}(x.)$ and $\mathcal{N}(y)\subset \mathcal{F}(x.)$, that is, $U$ and $V$ meets for any $U\in \mathcal{N(x)}$ and $V\in \mathcal{N(y)}$.

```


```{definition, , name=""}
Space $(\Omega,\tau)$ is said to be $T_{2.5}$ or **Completely Hausdorff** if for every pair $(x,y)\in \Omega^2$, there exist $U\in \mathcal{N(x)}$ and $V\in \mathcal{N(y)}$ s.t. $\overline{U}\cap \overline{V}=\emptyset$.
```

Two nonempty sets are caled **separated by open sets** if they are included in disjoint open sets, and they are **separated by continous functions** if there is continos $f$ taking values in $[0,1]$ and assign $0$ on one set and $1$ on the other.



Space $(\Omega,\tau)$ are said to be **regular** if every singeton and any closed $A$ disjoint from it can be separated by open sets.

```{definition, , name=""}
Space $(\Omega,\tau)$ is said to be $T_3$ if it's $T_1$ and regular.
```

Space $(\Omega,\tau)$ are said to **Completely regular** if every singeton and any closed $A$ disjoint from it can be separated by continous function.

```{definition, , name=""}
Space $(\Omega,\tau)$ is said to be $T_{3.5}$ or **Tychonoff space** if it's $T_1$ and completely regular.
```

```{theorem, tychemb, name="Tychonoff's Embedding Theorem"}
Space $(\Omega,\tau)$ is $T_{3.5}$ iff it's homeomorphic to a subspace of $([0,1]^n,\tau_{d_{l^1}})$.
```

Space $(\Omega,\tau)$ is said to be **normal** if two disjoint closed subsets can be separated by open sets.

```{definition, , name=""}
Space $(\Omega,\tau)$ is said to be $T_4$ if it's normal and $T_1$.
```




```{theorem, urs, name="Urysohn's Lemma"}
Following statements are equivalent:

1. $(\Omega,\tau)$ is normal. 
2. For any $U\in \tau$ and any closed $A\subset U$, there is a $U'\in \tau$ s.t. $A\subset U'$ and $\overline{U'}\subset U$.
3. Every two disjoint closed subsets can be separated by continous function.

```

```{proof}
$1 \implies 2$ Apply normal property to $A$ and $U^c$, there is a $U'$ include $A$ and $V$ include $U^c$, as $U'\cap V=\emptyset \implies U'\subset V^c\implies \overline{U'}\subset V^c \subset U$.

$2\implies 3$ Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two disjoint closed subset, apply $2$ to $A$ and $U_1=B^c$ we have $A\subset U_0$ and $\overline{U_0}\subset U_1$. Apply again for $\overline{U_0}$ and $U_1$ to generates $U_0\subset U_{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\overline{ U_{\frac{1}{2}}}\subset U_1$, repeat such process, that is, apply 2 to $\overline{U_{\frac{j}{2^k}}}$ and $U_{\frac{j+1}{2^k}}$ to generates $U_{\frac{2j+1}{2^{k+1}}}$. Finally, we construct a open strictly increasing squence $U_{r}.$ where $r$ is any dyadic rational in $[0,1]$, i.e., $r\in DR\cap [0,1]$.

Then define $f$ as

$$ f=\begin{cases}
    1& x\in B\\
    \inf \{r:x\in U_r\}& x\in B^c
\end{cases} $$

Then it's sufficient to show that $f$ is continous. Note subspace $[0,1]$ of $\R$ can be generated by collection of $[0,s)$ and $(t,1]$ and

$$ \begin{aligned}
    f^{-1}[0,s)=\bigcup_{r\in DR\cap [0,s)} U_r\\
    f^{-1}(t,1]=\bigcup_{r\in DR\cap (t,1]} \overline{U_r}^c
\end{aligned} $$

Then the claim follows from lemma \@ref(lem:contingen).

$3 \implies 1$ By taking any disjoint open set $A$ contains $0$ and $B$ contains $1$ and looking $f^{-1}(A)$ and $f^{-1}(B)$.
```

```{theorem, tietze, name="Tietze's Extension Theorem"}
Let $(\Omega,\tau)$ be normal, $F$ any closed subset and $I$ any bounded closed interval of $\R$. Then any continous $f:F\to I$ can be extended to $f':\Omega\to I$ and remain continous.
```

```{proof}
Suppose $I=[-1,1]$, then $A=f^{-1}[-1,-\frac{1}{3}]$ and $f^{-1}[\frac{1}{3},1]$ are disjoint and closed. By Urysohn's Lemma, there is $g:\Omega \to [-\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3}]$ s.t. $g(A)=\{-\frac{1}{3}\}$ and $g(B)=\frac{1}{3}$. Set $f_0=f,g_0=g,f_1=f-g|_F$. Then we can show that $|f_1|$ is bounded by $\frac{2}{3}$.

Repeat such process, we have series of 

$$ \begin{aligned}
    f_n&:F\to [-(\frac{2}{3})^n,(\frac{2}{3})^n]\\
    g_n&:E\to [-\frac{1}{3}(\frac{2}{3})^n,\frac{1}{3}(\frac{2}{3})^n]\\
    f_{n+1}&=(f_n-g_n)|_F
\end{aligned} $$

Then we show that $g=\sum_{i=0}^\infty g_i$ is the extension of $f$. That is $g$ is continous and $f=g$ in $F$. Note for any $x$

$$ \begin{aligned}
   | \sum_{i=m}^n g_i(x)|\le  \sum_{i=m}^n |g_i(x)|\le \sum_{i=m}^n \frac{1}{3}(\frac{2}{3})^i \le (\frac{2}{3})^m \to 0
\end{aligned} $$

Thus $\{\sum_{i=0}^n g_i\}_{n=0}^\infty$ converges uniformly by Cauchy's criterion, followed by $g$ is continous. And $f=g$ on $F$ follows from

$$ |f(x)-\sum_{i=0}^n g_i(x)|=|f_0(x)-\sum_{i=0}^n g_i(x)|=|f_1(x)-\sum_{i=1}^n g_i(x)|=|f_{n+1}(x)|\le (\frac{2}{3})^{n+1} \to 0 $$
