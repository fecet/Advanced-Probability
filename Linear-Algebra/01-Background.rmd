::: {.definition  name="Group"}

A group is a set $G$ with a binary low of composition
$$ 
\mu :G\times G\to G
$$
denoting as $\mu \left(x,y\right)=xy$.

-   $\left(xy\right)z=x\left(yz\right)$
-   There exists an element $e$ called the identity s.t. $xe=ex=x$ 
-   To each $x\in G$ there is an element $x^{-1}$ s.t. $x x^{-1}=x^{-1}x=e$

:::

Let $G$ and $H$ be two groups, then a mapping $\phi:G\to H$ is called a homomorphism if
$$ 
\phi\left(xy\right)=\phi x\phi y \qquad x,y\in G
$$

A group is called commutative or abelian if for each $x,y\in G$, $xy=yx$.


::: {.definition  name="field"}

A field is a set $K$ on which two binary lows of composition s.t. 

-   $K$ is a commutative group with respect to addition.
-   The set $K-\left\{ 0 \right\}$ is a commutative group with respect to multiplication.
-   Addition and multiplication are connected by the distributive low,
    $$ 
    \left(\alpha+\beta\right)\gamma=\alpha\gamma+\beta\gamma
    $$
