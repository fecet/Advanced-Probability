## Semicontinuous

$f:\Omega \to \R^*$ is

- **lower semicontinuous** if for any $c\in \R$, the set $\{x\in \Omega:f(x)\le c\}$ is closed.
- **upper semicontinuous** if for any $c\in \R$, the set $\{x\in \Omega:f(x)\ge c\}$ is closed.

Clearly $f$ is lower semicontinuous iff $-f$ is upper and vice versa.

```{lemma, , name=""}
Suppose $\{f_i\}_{i\in I}$ is family of lower(upper) semicontinuous function then $\sup f_i(\inf f_i)$ is lower(upper) semicontinuous.
```

```{proof}
Note

$$ \{x\in \Omega:\sup f_i(x)\le c\} =\bigcap_{i\in I} \{x\in \Omega:f_i(x)\le c\}$$

is closed.
```

```{lemma, , name=""}
$f:\Omega \to \R^*$ is

- **lower semicontinuous** iff for any net
  $$ x.\to x \implies \liminf f(x.) \ge f(x) $$
- **upper semicontinuous** iff for any net
  $$ x.\to x \implies \limsup f(x.) \le f(x) $$
  
```

```{proof}
Suppos $f$ is lower semicontinuous and $x.\to x$. For any $c<f(x)$, then $G=\{\omega\in \Omega:f(\omega)>c\}$ is open and thus $x.$ eventually in, that is $x.>c$ ecventually and thus $\liminf f(x.) \ge c$. This implies that $\liminf f(x.)\ge f(x)$.

Conversely, for any $c\in \R$, consider $F=\{\omega\in\Omega:f(\omega)\le c\}$. Then we show that $F$ is closed. Suppos $x.$ is nets in $F$ and converges to some $x\in \Omega$. Then $c\ge \lim\inf f(x.) \ge f(x)$ thus $x$ in $F$ and thus $F$ is closed.
