## Compatness

A **cover** of a set $K$ is collection of sets whose union includes $K$. A **subcover** is subcollection of a cover and also covers $K$. $K$ is **compact** if every open cover has a finite subcover and called **relatively compact** if it's closure is comapct.

A topology $(\Omega,\tau)$ is **compact** if $\Omega$ is compact and **locally compact** if every point has a compact neighborhood. A subset $A\in \Omega$.



```{theorem, cptset, name=""}

Let $(\Omega,\tau)$ be a space, $A\subset \Omega$ is compact iff any collection $\mathcal{F}_A$ of closed sets in subspace $\tau_A$ with the finite intersection property have $\ker \mathcal{F}\neq \emptyset$.

```

```{proof}
Suppose $\mathcal{F}_A=\{F \cap A:F\in \mathcal{F}\}$, then

$$ \ker \mathcal{F}_A = \bigcap_{F\in \mathcal{F}}^{}F\cap A=\emptyset \iff \bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{F}}^{}(F^c\cup A^c)=\Omega \iff \bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{F}}^{} F^c\supset A  $$

As finite intersection property, $\mathcal{I}$ any finite subfaimily.

$$ \bigcap_{F\in \mathcal{I}} F\cap A \supset \emptyset \iff \bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{I}}^{}(F^c\cup A^c)\subset \Omega \iff \bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{I}}^{} F^c \subset A  $$

where the inclusion is proper. That is, open cover $\bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{F}}^{} F^c\supset A$ can not have a finite subcover and thus $A$ isn't compact.

```{theorem, , name=""}
Let $(\Omega,\tau)$ be a space, following are equivalent.

1. $(\Omega,\tau)$ is compact.
2. Every filter(net) has at least one adherent point.
3. Every ultrafilter(ultranet) converges.

```

```{proof}
$1\implies 2$ Suppose filter $\mathcal{F}$, then

$$ \{\overline{F}:F\in \mathcal{F}\} $$

enjoy finite intersection property by definition, then $\overline{F}$ has at least one adherent point since $\ker \{\overline{F}:F\in \mathcal{F}\}=\overline{\mathcal{F}} \neq \emptyset$ by theorem \@ref(thm:cptset).

$2\implies 3$ Clearly by corollary \@ref(cor:adhlim3).

$3 \implies 1$ Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ a family of closed subsets with finite intersection property. Then the filter generates by $\mathcal{A}$ has an ultrafilter with a limit point $x$. Note $x$ is also adherent to $\mathcal{U}$ and thus adherent to $\mathcal{F}$, followed by $x\in A$ for any $A\in \mathcal{A}$, hence $\ker \mathcal{A} \supset \{x\}$. Then the claim follows from theorem \@ref(thm:cptset).
