## Compatness

A **cover** of a set $K$ is collection of sets whose union includes $K$. A **subcover** is subcollection of a cover and also covers $K$. $K$ is **compact** if every open cover has a finite subcover and called **relatively compact** if it's closure is comapct.

A topology $(\Omega,\tau)$ is **compact** if $\Omega$ is compact and **locally compact** if every point has a compact neighborhood. A subset $A\in \Omega$.



```{theorem, cptset, name=""}

Let $(\Omega,\tau)$ be a space, $A\subset \Omega$ is compact iff any collection $\mathcal{F}_A$ of closed sets in subspace $\tau_A$ with the finite intersection property have $\ker \mathcal{F}\neq \emptyset$.

```

```{proof}
Suppose $\mathcal{F}_A=\{F \cap A:F\in \mathcal{F}\}$, then

$$ \ker \mathcal{F}_A = \bigcap_{F\in \mathcal{F}}^{}F\cap A=\emptyset \iff \bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{F}}^{}(F^c\cup A^c)=\Omega \iff \bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{F}}^{} F^c\supset A  $$

As finite intersection property, $\mathcal{I}$ any finite subfaimily.

$$ \bigcap_{F\in \mathcal{I}} F\cap A \supset \emptyset \iff \bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{I}}^{}(F^c\cup A^c)\subset \Omega \iff \bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{I}}^{} F^c \subset A  $$

where the inclusion is proper. That is, open cover $\bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{F}}^{} F^c\supset A$ can not have a finite subcover and thus $A$ isn't compact.

```

```{theorem, cptequiv, name=""}
Let $(\Omega,\tau)$ be a space, following are equivalent.

1. $(\Omega,\tau)$ is compact.
2. Every filter(net) has at least one adherent point.
3. Every ultrafilter(ultranet) converges.
4. $\ker \mathcal{F}\neq \emptyset$ For every collection $\mathcal{F}$ of closed sets having FIP.

```

```{proof}
$1\implies 2$ Suppose filter $\mathcal{F}$, then

$$ \{\overline{F}:F\in \mathcal{F}\} $$

enjoy finite intersection property by definition, then $\overline{F}$ has at least one adherent point since $\ker \{\overline{F}:F\in \mathcal{F}\}=\overline{\mathcal{F}} \neq \emptyset$ by theorem \@ref(thm:cptset).

$2\implies 3$ Clearly by corollary \@ref(cor:adhlim3).

$3 \implies 1$ Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ a family of closed subsets with finite intersection property. Then the filter generates by $\mathcal{A}$ has an ultrafilter with a limit point $x$. Note $x$ is also adherent to $\mathcal{U}$ and thus adherent to $\mathcal{F}$, followed by $x\in A$ for any $A\in \mathcal{A}$, hence $\ker \mathcal{A} \supset \{x\}$. Then the claim follows from theorem \@ref(thm:cptset).


$4\iff 1$ Taking contrapositive:

$$ \neg {\ker \mathcal{F}\neq\emptyset}\equiv\ker \mathcal{F}=\emptyset\equiv\bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{F}} F^c=\Omega $$

and

$$\neg \forall \bigcap_{i}^n F_i=\emptyset \equiv  \exists\bigcup_{i}^n F_i^c=\Omega $$

note that's pricesly the definition of compactness.

```{theorem, cptcl, name=""}
Let $(\Omega , \tau )$ be Hausdorff, then every compact subset and disjoint singelton can be separated by open sets. In particular, compact subset is closed.
```

```{proof}
Suppose $F\subset \Omega$ is compact, for any $x\in \Omega$ not in $F$, by Hausdorff, there is $x\notin U_y$ and $y\notin V_y$. Then $\bigcup_{y\in F} U_y$ cover $F$, there is subcover $U=\bigcup_{i}^n U_{y_i}$ and $V=\bigcup_{i}^n V_{y_i}$ selected from the same family separated $F$ and $\{x\}$.
```


<!-- ```{proof}
Suppose there is $x\notin A$ and $x\in \overline{A}$, then there is a filter $\mathcal{F}$ converges to $x$, by theorem \@ref(thm:t2equiv), $\mathop{\text{Adh}}_{\tau}(\mathcal{F})=\{x\}$, that implies $\mathop{\text{Adh}}_{\tau_A}(\mathcal{F})=\emptyset$ by noting
$$ \mathop{\text{Adh}}_{\tau_A}(\mathcal{F})=\bigcap_{F\in \mathcal{F}} \mathop{\text{Cl}}_{\tau_A}(F)=\bigcap_{F\in \mathcal{F}} \mathop{\text{Cl}}_{\tau}(F)\cap A=\mathop{\text{Adh}}_{\tau}(\mathcal{F})\cap A$$
and contradict the compactness as theorem \@ref(thm:cptequiv).2. Thus $A=\overline{A}$ and thus closed.

```{theorem, clcpt, name=""}
Closed subset is compact in compact topological space.
```

```{proof}
Note any open cover of $F$ plus $F^c$ become a open cover of $\Omega$.
```

<!-- ```{proof}
Suppose $F$ is closed and $\mathcal{U}$ is any ultrafilter in $F$, then it's base of an ulrafilter containing $F$ in $(\Omega,\tau)$, as compactness, this ultrafilter converges to some $x$. Then we claim that $x\in F$ and thus $\mathcal{U}$ also converges to $x$. By theorem \@ref(thm:cptequiv), $F$ is compact.
``` -->


```{theorem, , name=""}
Every compact Hausdorff space is normal.
```

```{proof}
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are closed and thus comapct by theorem \@ref(thm:clcpt). For any point $x\in A$, there exist disjoint $V_x \supset B$ and $x\in U_x$ by theorem \@ref(thm:cptcl). Note $\bigcup_{x\in A} U_x$ cover $A$, there exist subcover $U=\bigcup_i^n U_{x_i}\supset A$ and $V=\bigcap_i^n V_{x_i}\supset B$ separated $A$ and $B$.
```

```{theorem, contcpt, name=""}
Suppose $f:(\Omega,\tau ) \to (\Omega',\tau ')$ is continous, then $f(A)$ is comapct if $A$ is compact.
```

```{proof}
For any open cover of $f(A)$:

$$ \cup G_i \supset f(A)\implies f^{-1}(\cup G_i)=\cup f^{-1}(G_i) \supset f^{-1}f(A)\supset A$$

Thus there exist subcover s.t.

$$ \cup_1^n f^{-1}(G_i)=f^{-1}(\cup_1^n G_i)\supset A \implies\cup_1^n G_i\supset ff^{-1}(\cup_1^n G_i)\supset f(A)$$

which shows that $f(A)$ is compact.
```

As consequence:

```{corollary, exvalue, name="Extreme value theorem"}
A continous real valued function defined on a compact space achieves its maximum and minimum values.
```





```{theorem, , name=""}
Let $(\Omega,\tau)$ be compact and $(\Omega',\tau')$ be housdorff and $f:(\Omega,\tau )\to (\Omega',\tau')$ is continous bijection. Then $f$ is homeomorphism.
```

```{proof}
It's sufficient to show that $f(F)$ is closed as lemma \@ref(lem:homoclopen). Note $F$ is closed and thus compact as theorem \@ref(thm:clcpt) then $f(F)$ is compact as theorem \@ref(thm:contcpt) and thus closed by theorem \@ref(thm:cptcl).
```

A subset $A$ of a topological space is **sequentially compact** if every sequence in $A$ has a subsequence converging to an element of $A$. A topological space is sequentially compact if itself is a sequentially compact set.
