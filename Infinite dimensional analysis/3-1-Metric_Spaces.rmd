A metric on a set $X$ is a function $d:X\times X\to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying:
- $d(x,y)\ge 0$ and $d(x,x)=0$ for all $x,y\in X$ 
- $d(x,y)=0\implies x=y$ 
- $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$ for all $x,y\in X$ 
- $d(x,y)\le d(y,z)+d(x,z)$ for all $x,y,z\in X$

A semimetric on $X$ is a function $d:X\times X\to \mathbb{R}$ which satisfies the condition 1,3,4.  
If $d$ is a metric on $X$, then $(X,d)$ is called a metric space.

:::

Give a metric space $(X,d)$, and $A\subset X$, we said the diameter of $A$ is 
$$ 
\text{diam} A=\sup\{d(x,y):x,y\in A\}
$$
A set $A$ is bounded if $\text{diam}A\lt\infty$ while $A$ is unbounded if $\text{diam}A=\infty$.

Let $(X,d)$ be a semimetric space. $A\subset X$ is d-open if for each $a\in A$ there exists some $r>0$ s.t. $B_r(a)\subset A$.  
Then consider about the family $\{A\subset X:A\text{ is d-open}\}$, it generates a topology on $X$, denoted as $\tau_d$.

::: {.lemma  name=""}

Let $(X,d)$ be a semimetric space. Then:
1. $(X,\tau_d)$ is Hausdorff space iff $d$ is a metric
2. A sequence $(x_n)$ in $X$ satisfies $x_n\to x$ in $(X,\tau_{d})$ iff $d(x_n,x)\to 0$
3. Every $d$-open ball is an open set
4. The topology $\tau_d$ is first countable
5. A point $x\in \overline{A}$ of some $A\subset X$ iff there exists some sequence $(x_n)$ in $A$ with $(x_n)\to x$.
6. A closed ball is a closed set.
7. The closure of the open ball $B_r(	x)$ is included in the closed ball $C_r(x)$.
8. If $(X,d_1)$ and $(Y,d_2)$ are semimetric spaces, the product topology on $X\times Y$ is generated by the semimetric 
$$ 
D((x,y),(u,v))=d_1(x,u)+d_2(y,v)
$$
9. For any four points $u,v,x,y$ the semimetric obeys: 
$$ 
\lvert d(x,y)-d(u,v) \rvert\le d(x,u)+d(y,v)
$$
10. The real funtion $d:X\times X\to \mathbb{R}$ is jointly continuous.

A metrizable space is separable iff it is second countable.

::: {.proof}

Let $(X,\tau_{})$ is a second countable space. There exists a topology base $\mathcal{B}=\{B_{i}:i=1,2,\ldots\}$, let $A=\{x_{i}:i=1,2,\ldots\}$ where $x_{i}\in B_{i}$ is arbitrary get. Then it is easy to show that $\overline{A}=X$ which means every give any point  $x\in X$, $U\in \mathcal{N_x}$, $U$ intersects $A$. Notice that for any open set $U$, there is some  $B_i\in \{B_{i}\}$ s.t. $B_{i}\subset U$. Now give some $x\notin A$, let $U_x\in \mathcal{N_x}$, then $B_{i}\subset U_x$ for some $i$, and there is at least a point $x_{i}\in B_{i}$ s.t. $U_x\cap A\supset\{x_{i}\}\neq \varnothing$.  
Let $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $(X,\tau_{d})$ is a topological space generated by $d$. Let $A=\{x_{i}:i=1,2,\ldots\}$ be a countable dense subset in $X$. Then the collection $\{B_{\frac{1}{n}}\}$
