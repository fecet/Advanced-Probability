## Convergence

If $\mathcal{F}$ is collection of functions on $X$, $X$ can be seen as functions on $\mathcal{F}$ by $e_x(f)=f(x)$ for each $x \in  X$, such functions are called  **evaluation functional**. 

The product topology on $\R^X$ is also called **topology of pointwise convergence** on $X$ because a net $f.\to f$ iff $e_x(f.)\to e_x(f)\iff f.(x)\to f(x)$ for each $x \in X$.

 There also exist induced topology $\sigma\left( \mathcal{F},X \right)$ on $\mathcal{F}$, which is identical to the subspace  $\R^X |_{\mathcal{F}}$ endowed the product topology. Formally 

$$ \sigma(\mathcal{F},X)=\sigma(\R^X,X)|_{\mathcal{F}} $$

::: {.lemma  name=""}

If $\mathcal{F}$ is total, the function 

$$ x\mapsto e_x:(X,\sigma(X,\mathcal{F}))\to (\R^{\mathcal{F}},\sigma(\R^{\mathcal{F}},\mathcal{F})) $$

is injective and thus an embedding.

:::

::: {.proof}

It's remain to show the continuity.

$$ \begin{aligned}
	 x. \to x &\iff \forall  f \in \mathcal{F}, f(x.) \to f(x) 
	 \\&\iff \forall f \in \mathcal{F}, e_{f}(e_{x.})\to e_f(e_{x})
	 \\&\iff e_{x.}\to e_{x} 
\end{aligned} $$

By Tychonoff theorem \@ref(thm:tychonoff), $\mathcal{F}$ is compact iff $\forall x \in X$, $\{f(x)\}_{f\in \mathcal{F}}$ it's closed and pointwise bounded by borel theorem. 

::: {.definition name=""}

A net $f.$ converges uniformly to $f\in \R^X$ iff $|f.(x)-f(x)|< \epsilon$ eventually for each $x \in X$ after some $f_{\alpha}$ for any $\epsilon$.

::: {.theorem  name=""}

The uniform limit of a continuous net is continuous.

:::


::: {.proof}

Suppose $f.\to f$ uniformly, then for any $x\in X$, for any $\alpha>\alpha_0$
$$ 
|f_\alpha(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon
$$
as $f_\alpha$ is continuous, for any $x. \to x$, for any $\lambda>\lambda_0$
$$ 
|f_\alpha(x_\lambda)-f_\alpha(x)|<\epsilon
$$
also, there is 
$$ 
|f_\alpha(x_\lambda)-f(x_\lambda)|<\epsilon
$$
Hence, we have 
$$ 
|f(x_\lambda)-f(x)|<3\epsilon
$$

Thus, $f(x.)\to f$ and continuity follows.

::: {.theorem #dini name="Dini's Theorem"}

If continuous real function net $f.$ on a compact set converges monotonically to $f$ pointwise, then the net converges to $f$ uniformly.

:::

If $f. \to f$, $f.(x)\to f(x)$ for each $x$ and thus $f.(x)$ eventually in $B(f(x),\epsilon)$ after, say, $f_{\alpha_x}$. Note

$$ X=\bigcup_{x \in X} f_{\alpha_x}^{-1}(B(f(x),\epsilon))=\bigcup_{x \in J} f_{\alpha_x}^{-1}(B(f(x),\epsilon)) $$

by compactness, so we may pick $\alpha_0 \ge \alpha_x$ for all $x\in J$, and now for any $x\in X$, suppose $x\in f_{\alpha_{x_j}}^{-1}\left( B(f(x_j),\epsilon) \right)$
$$ 
|f_\alpha (x)-f(x)|\le  |f_{\alpha}(x)-f(x_j)|+|f(x_j)-f(x)|
$$
