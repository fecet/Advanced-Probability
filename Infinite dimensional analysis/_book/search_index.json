The sets in \\(\\tau\\) are called open while sets with complement in \\(\\tau\\) is closed. Both open and closed set is called clopen. Definition 2.2 () \\((X,\\rho)\\) is a semimetric space, when \\(\\rho\\) defined on \\(X\\times X\\) s.t. \\(\\forall x,y,z \\in X\\): \\(\\rho(x,y)\\ge 0\\) \\(\\rho(x,y)=\\rho(y,x)\\) \\(\\rho(x,y)\\le\\rho(x,z)+\\rho(z,y)\\) \\(\\rho\\) is called a semimetric. If \\(\\rho(x,y)=0\\iff x=y\\), \\(\\rho\\) become a metric and \\((X,\\rho)\\) become metric space. \\(B(a,r)=\\{x\\in E,d(x,a)&lt;r\\}\\) is \\(r\\)-ball with center \\(a\\). \\(U\\) is open in \\((\\Omega,d)\\) iff \\(\\forall x\\in U, \\exists r_x&gt; 0 \\ni B_d(x,r_x)\\subseteq U\\). Let \\(\\tau_d\\) be the set of all open subsets of \\(\\Omega\\), we call \\(\\tau_d\\) the topology generated by \\(d\\). A Topological space is metrizable if there exist metric \\(d\\) generates it. Suppose \\(d\\) is discrete, that is, \\(d(x,y)=0\\) iff \\(x=y\\), otherwise, \\(d(x,y)=1\\). Then every subset is open hence \\(\\tau_d=\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\) and called discrete topology. The zero semimetric, defined by \\(d(x,y)=0\\) for all \\(x,y\\in \\Omega\\) generates \\(\\tau_d=\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega\\}\\) and called trivial topology. Let \\(\\Omega=\\mathbb{R}^n\\), \\(l^2=\\sqrt{\\sum_1^n(x_i-y_i)^2}\\) is called Euclidean metric. \\(l^1=\\sum_1^n|x_i-y_i|\\) is called texi-cab metric and \\(l^\\infty=\\sup\\{|x_i-y_i|\\}\\) is called sup norm metric. Note \\(d_{l^2}(x,y)\\le d_{l^1}(x,y)\\le \\sqrt{n}d_{l^2}(x,y)\\) and \\(d_{l^2}(x,y)\\le \\sqrt{n}d_{l^\\infty}(x,y)\\le \\sqrt{n}d_{l^2}(x,y)\\), then \\(d_{l^\\infty}\\) open \\(\\iff d_{l^2}\\) open \\(\\iff\\) \\(d_{l^1}\\) open. Hence \\(\\tau_{d_{l^2}}=\\tau_{d_{l^1}}=\\tau_{d_{l^\\infty}}\\). All topologies on \\(\\Omega\\) is poset with greatest element \\(\\mathcal{P(\\Omega )}\\) and least \\(\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega\\}\\). If \\(\\tau&#39;\\subset \\tau\\), we say \\(\\tau&#39;\\) coarser than \\(\\tau\\) while \\(\\tau\\) finer than \\(\\tau&#39;\\). If \\(\\tau\\) can be form by taking union of families in some \\(\\mathcal{B}\\subset \\tau\\), we call \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) the base for the topology \\(\\tau\\). Theorem 2.1 () \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is a base in \\((X,\\tau)\\) iff \\(\\forall U\\in \\tau,\\forall x\\in U, \\exists W\\in \\mathcal{B}\\ni x\\in W\\subset U\\). Proof. \\(\\implies\\): Any \\(U\\) can be written as \\(U=\\cup W_i\\) and \\(x\\in U\\implies x\\in W_i\\) for some \\(i\\) and \\(W_i\\in \\mathcal{B}\\). \\(\\impliedby\\): For any \\(U\\in T\\), consider arbitary \\(x\\in U\\), then there exist \\(W_x\\) such that \\(x\\in W_x \\subset U\\), thus we have \\(U=\\cup_x W_x\\). \\(\\mathcal{S}\\subset \\tau\\) is a subbase for \\(\\tau\\) if all finite intersections of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is a base. Let \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) be a class of subset in \\(X\\), the define \\(\\tau(\\mathcal{S})\\) as all topology contains \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). Let \\(\\tau(S)=\\cap \\tau(\\mathcal{S})\\), then \\(\\tau(\\mathcal{S})\\) is the smallest topology contains \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). We call it the topology generated by \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). Theorem 2.2 () \\(\\tau(\\mathcal{S})\\) is unions of families of finite intersections together with \\(\\Omega\\), formally: \\[ \\{\\bigcup(\\bigcap_1^N S_i)\\}\\cup \\Omega \\] A subset \\(V\\) is called a neighborhood of \\(a\\) if there exists a open set \\(U\\subset V\\) contains \\(a\\). Then we called \\(V&#39;=V-\\{a\\}\\) punctured(deleted) neighborhood. A neighborhood base is a collection of neighborhood \\(BN(a)\\) s.t. for any neighborhood \\(V\\) of \\(a\\), there exist a \\(W\\in BN(a)\\) and \\(W\\subset V\\). A subset \\(U\\) is open iff it’s a neighborhood for each of its points. Proof \\(\\implies\\) is trival. \\(\\impliedby\\) follows from \\(\\cup_x G_x=U\\) and unions of open set is still open. \\(\\blacksquare\\) This suggest a equivalent definition of finear topology: \\(T&#39;\\subset T\\iff\\) T’ neighborhood is a T neighborhood. Proof \\(\\implies\\) any open set \\(G_x\\) satisfy \\(x\\in G_x\\subset V\\) in \\(T&#39;\\) is still open in \\(T\\), hence \\(V\\) is \\(T\\) neighborhood. \\(\\impliedby\\) Consider any open set \\(G\\in T&#39;\\), it’s a \\(T&#39;\\) neighborhood for each of its points implies it’s a \\(T\\) neighborhood for each of its points and hence \\(G\\) is \\(T\\) open. The interior of \\(A\\) is the union of all open sets which are included \\(A\\), i.e., the largest open set included in \\(A\\), we denote it \\(A^\\circ\\). And the closure is the intersection of all closed sets which include \\(A\\) and thus the smallest closed set includes \\(A\\), we denote it \\(\\overline{A}\\). \\((A\\cap B)^\\circ=A^\\circ \\cap B^\\circ\\) \\(\\overline{A\\cup B}=\\overline{A}\\cup \\overline{B}\\) \\(A \\subset \\overline{B}\\implies \\overline{A}\\subset \\overline{B}\\) \\(A^\\circ\\subset B\\implies A^\\circ \\subset B^\\circ\\) \\(\\overline{A^c}=(A^\\circ)^c\\) \\((\\overline{A})^c=(A^c)^\\circ\\) Proof We only prove 5, note \\((A^\\circ)^c\\) is closed and \\[ A^\\circ\\subset A\\implies (A^c)\\subset (A^\\circ)^c \\] we have \\(\\overline{A^c}\\subset (A^\\circ)^c\\). On the other hand \\[\\overline{A^c}\\supset (A^\\circ)^c\\impliedby (\\overline{A^c})^c\\subset A^\\circ\\impliedby (\\overline{A^c})^c \\subset A \\impliedby \\overline{A^c}\\supset A^c.\\blacksquare \\] The frontier of \\(A\\) is \\(\\partial A=\\overline{A}\\cap \\overline{A^c}=\\overline{A}\\cap (A^\\circ)^c=\\overline{A}-A^\\circ\\). \\(\\overline{A}=A \\cup \\partial A\\) and \\(A^\\circ=A-\\partial A\\) Proof \\[ \\begin{aligned} A\\cup \\partial A&amp;= A\\cup (\\overline{A}\\cap \\overline{A^c}) \\\\&amp;= (A\\cup \\overline{A})\\cap (A\\cup \\overline{A^c}) \\\\&amp;= ( \\overline{A})\\cap (A\\cup (A^\\circ)^c) \\end{aligned} \\] note \\(A\\cup (A^\\circ)^c\\supset A^\\circ\\cup (A^\\circ)^c=\\Omega\\), \\(A\\cup \\partial A=\\overline{A}\\cap \\Omega=\\overline{A}\\). And the \\(A^\\circ=A-\\partial A\\) follows from substituting \\(\\overline{A}=A \\cup \\partial A\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\) \\(x\\) is said to be an interior point of \\(A\\) if \\(A\\) is neighborhood of \\(x\\). \\(x\\) is said to be an adherent point if it’s every neighborhood meets \\(A\\), an \\(\\omega\\) accumulation point of \\(A\\) if every neighborhood of \\(x\\) contains infinitely many points of \\(A\\) and is a condensation point of \\(A\\) if every neighborhood of \\(x\\) contains uncountable many points of \\(A\\). \\(x\\) is a cluster point or accumulation point if every deleted neighborhood of \\(x\\) meets \\(A\\) and is isolated point if \\(x\\) is not cluster point. \\(x\\) is frontier point if every neighborhood of \\(x\\) meets both \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\). The points of \\(A^\\circ\\) are precisely all the interior points of \\(A\\) and \\(\\overline{A}\\) are precisely all the adherent points. Proof For interior points, consider \\(I\\) as all the interior points, it’s sufficient to show that \\(I=A^\\circ\\) \\[I\\subset \\bigcup_{x\\in I} G_x \\subset A^\\circ \\] where \\(G_x\\) is the corresponding open set. On the other hand we have \\(A^\\circ \\subset I\\) since every points in \\(A^\\circ\\) has \\(A^\\circ\\) as their neighborhood. For interior points, suppose \\(x\\in \\overline{A}\\) but is not an adherent point, then there is a open \\(G\\) contains \\(x\\) and \\(G\\cap A=\\emptyset\\). Hence \\(A\\subset G^c\\), note \\(G^c\\) is closed and thus \\(G^c\\supset \\overline{A}\\), which is contradict to \\(x\\in \\overline{A}\\). On the other hand, suppose \\(x\\) is adherent but not in \\(\\overline{A}\\). Then \\(\\overline{A}^c\\) is a neghborhood of \\(A\\) and disjoint to \\(\\overline{A}\\), a contradition. \\(\\blacksquare\\). By above theorem, we have \\(\\partial A\\) is precisely points of frontier. Proof By definition, point of frontier is both adherent point of \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\) and thus all the points of frontier are \\[ \\overline{A}\\cap\\overline{A^c}=\\partial A \\] For any subset \\(X\\), define \\(\\alpha(X)=(\\overline{A})^\\circ\\), then \\(X\\subset Y\\implies \\alpha(X)\\subset \\alpha(Y)\\) If \\(X\\) is open, \\(X\\subset \\alpha(X)\\) \\(\\alpha(\\alpha(X))=\\alpha(X)\\) If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are disjoint open then \\(\\alpha(X)\\) and \\(\\alpha(Y)\\) are also. If \\(\\alpha(X)=X\\), \\(X\\) is said to be regular open Proof 2 follows from \\(X\\subset \\overline{X}\\implies X\\subset \\alpha(X)\\). To estabish 3, we show that \\(A^\\circ\\) is regular open when \\(A\\) is closed and \\(\\overline{A}\\) is regular open when \\(A\\) is open. When \\(A\\) is closed, \\(\\partial A\\subset A\\), then \\[ \\overline{A^\\circ}=(A-\\partial A)\\cup \\partial A=A \\implies \\alpha(A^\\circ)=A^\\circ\\] Hence \\(\\alpha(X)=(\\overline{A})^\\circ\\) is regular open since \\(\\overline{A}\\) is closed. For 4, suppose there is \\(x\\in \\alpha(X)\\cap \\alpha(Y)\\), then \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\alpha(X)\\cap \\alpha(Y)=(\\overline{X}\\cap \\overline{Y})^\\circ\\subset \\overline{X}\\cap \\overline{Y} \\end{aligned} \\] hence \\(x\\) is adherent to both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), note \\(X\\) is neighborhood of \\(x\\) and \\(X\\) meets \\(Y\\) by definition, a contradiction. \\(\\blacksquare\\) Finite intesection of regular open sets is regular open Proof Let \\((G_i)_{i\\in I}\\) be a finite family of regular open sets. We have \\[ \\bigcap_{i\\in I} G_i\\subset \\alpha(\\bigcap_{i\\in I} G_i)\\subset \\alpha(G_i)=G_i \\] holds for all \\(G_i\\), hence \\(\\alpha(\\bigcap_{i\\in I} G_i)\\subset \\bigcap_{i\\in I} G_i\\), then the claim follows. \\(\\blacksquare\\) \\(\\partial (\\overline{A}) \\subset \\partial A\\) and \\(\\partial(A^\\circ)\\subset \\partial A\\) \\(\\partial(A\\cup B)\\subset \\partial A\\cup \\partial B\\) Proof: 2: Suppose \\(x\\in \\partial (A\\cup B)\\), then any neighborhood \\(N\\) meet \\(A\\cup B\\) and \\(A^c\\cap B^c\\). W.L.O.G, we assume \\(N\\) meet \\(A\\), since \\(N\\) also meet \\(A^c\\), \\(x\\in \\partial A\\subset \\partial A\\cup \\partial B\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\) \\(A\\) is said dense if \\(\\overline{A}=\\Omega\\) and nowhere dense if \\((\\overline{A})^\\circ=\\emptyset\\) (\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) while \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) is nowhere dense.) \\(A\\) is said to be meagre or set of the first category if it’s countable union of nowhere dense. Sets which are not meagre is set of the second category set. Space \\((\\Omega,\\tau)\\) is first countable if every point of \\(\\Omega\\) has countable neighborhood base. The space is said separable if \\(\\Omega\\) has a countable dense subset. Second countable space is separable Proof Suppose \\(\\mathcal{B}=(B_i)_{i\\in I}\\) is a countable base, by axiom of choice, we may take \\(x_i\\) in \\(I\\), let \\(X=\\{x_i\\}_{i\\in I}\\subset \\Omega\\). Then we show that \\(X\\) is dense. For any \\(x\\in \\Omega\\), it’s neighborhood must contain some open \\(G\\) which is unions of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) and thus contains at least one element in \\(X\\), that is, \\(G\\) meet \\(X\\). Hence \\(\\overline{X}=\\Omega\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\) Second countable space is first countable Suppose \\(\\mathcal{B}=(B_i)_{i\\in I}\\) is a countable base, for each point \\(x\\in \\Omega\\), one may take all the sets in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) which contains \\(x\\) as a neighborhood base. To verify it’s neighborhood base, if there is a neighborhood \\(N\\) of \\(x\\), then there is a open \\(G\\) contains \\(x\\). By the definition of base, \\(G\\) is the union of sets of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) and those sets must at least one contains \\(x\\) and these sets is subset to \\(G\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\) $$ "]]
