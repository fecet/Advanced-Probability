# Concentration without independence

## Concentration of Lipschitz functions on the sphere

### Lipschitz functions


::: {.definition  name=""}

Suppose function space between metric spaces $Y^{X}$, then $f$ is called **lipschitz** if there exist $L \in \mathbb{R}$ $s.t.$
$$
d_Y(f(u),f(v))\le L d_{X}(u,v)
$$
the infimum of all $L$ is defined as Lipschitz norm of $f$ and denoted as $\left\| \cdot \right\|_{Lip}$.

Lipschitz functions form an intermediate class between uniformly continuous and differentiable functions:


::: {.proposition  name=""}

Lipschitz function is uniformly continuous and differentiable function must be Lipschitz:
$$
\left\| f \right\|_{Lip}\le \sup \left\| \nabla f(x) \right\|
$$
