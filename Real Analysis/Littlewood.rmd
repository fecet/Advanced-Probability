# Littlewood's three principles

Littlewood's three principles are as follows:

1. Every measurable set is nearly a finite sum of intervals.
2. Every integrable function is nearly continuous
3. Every pointwise convergent sequence of functions is nearly uniformly.

## Littlewood's first principles

Suppose $E\subset \mathbb{R^d}$ and $m(E)<\infty$, then $E$ is almost finite open interval sum, formally, there exist finite class of open interval $I_i$, s.t., $m(\cup I_i\Delta E)=m(\cup I_i-E)+m(E-\cup I_i)<\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon$.

**Proof** Suppose 

$$I_1=B(0,1),I_2=B(0,2)-B(0,1),I_n=B(0,n)-B(0,n-1),\cdots$$

then $\cup_1^\infty I_i=\mathbb{R^d}$ and thus

$$ \begin{aligned}
    m(E)&=m(E\cap \mathbb{R^d})
    \\&=m(E\cap(\cup_1^\infty I_i))
    \\&=m(\cup_1^\infty(E \cap I_i))
    \\&=\sum_1^\infty m(E\cap I_i)
\end{aligned} $$

since $m(E)$ is finite, $\sum_1^\infty m(E\cap I_i)$ is converge, thus we may find $N_\epsilon$ s.t. for all $n>N_\epsilon$, $m(E)-\sum_1^n m(E\cap I_i)<\epsilon$, noting every $\sum_1^n m(E\cap I_i)$ correspond to a bounded measurable subset of $E$, we have show that $E$ is almost bounded since there exist $A\subset E$ s.t. $m(E-A)<\epsilon$.

For any measurable $A$, we may find closed $F\subset A$ s.t. $m(A-F)<\epsilon$, i.e., $A$ is almost closed and thus $E$ is almost compact. Then the results is immediately by the Heine-Borel theorem. $\blacksquare$

## Littlewood's second principle

> Suppose $f:\mathbb{R^d}\to \mathbb{R^d}$ is integrable, then $\forall \epsilon> 0$, there exists
> 
> 1. 
>    An integrable simple funtion $g$ s.t.
>
> 2.
>    An integrable step funtion $g$ s.t.
> 3. 
>    A continuous $g$ with compact support s.t.
> $$ \int|f-g|< \epsilon $$

**Proof** **1** is immediately by the definition of integral of non-negative function then spliting measurable $f=f^+-f^-$ and adjusting $\epsilon$.

**2** is sufficient to show this when $f$ is simple and again sufficient to show this when $f$ is indicator fuction of a finite measure set(since integrable), say, $f=\chi_E$. By littlewood first principle, $E$ is nearly finite sum of open interval where we may define the step function: $g=\chi_{\cup I_i}$. Then the claim follows from

$$ \int \chi_E-\int g=m(E)- m(\cup I_i)<m(E-\cup I_i)<m(E\Delta \cup I_i)<\epsilon$$

**3** is sufficient to show when $f$ is indicator on a interval $E$, then one may define

$$ g=\max(1-\delta d(x,E),0) $$

where $g$ is continous and $g=1-\delta d(x,E)$ at $A_\delta=\{x:0<d(x,E)<\frac{1}{\delta}\}$ and $g=\chi_E$ otherwise. 

$$ \int g-\int f=\int_{A_\delta}g+(\int_{A_\delta^c} g-\int f)=\int_{A_\delta} g \le m(A_\delta)$$

Note we may choose $\delta$ s.t. $m(A_\delta)<\epsilon$(since $\lim_{\delta\to \infty} A_\delta=\emptyset$) and $g$ has compact support $\overline{A_\delta+E}$. $\blacksquare$


### Lusin's theorem

Another version of littlewood's second principle is known as **Lusin's throrem**.

> Let $f$ be integrable and $\epsilon>0$, there exist a $E$ s.t. the restriction of $f_{E}$ is continous and $m(R^d-E)<\epsilon$.

**Proof** By the littlewood's second principle, there is a series of continous function $f_n$ with compact support s.t. 

$$\int |f-f_n|\le\frac{\epsilon}{4^n}$$

Let $A_n=\{|f(x)-f_n(x)|>\frac{1}{2^n}\}$, by markov inequality:

$$\frac{\epsilon}{4^n} \ge \int |f-f_n|\ge  m(A_n)/2^n \implies m(A_n)\le\frac{\epsilon}{2^n}$$

Note $|f(x)-f_n(x)|\le \frac{1}{2^n}$ outside of $A_n$ and $m(A:=\cup_1^\infty A_n)\le 1$, we conclude that $f\to f_n$ almost uniformly (by ignoring an arbitary small set $A$). Then the claim follows from uniformly limit of continous function is continuous. $\blacksquare$

**Remark** By the the inner regularity of measurable set, the restriction may be compact. Then by [**Tietze theorem**](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/29655759)

> There exist a extend $g$ of function $f$ from any closed subset $C$ to $\Omega$, s.t. $g$ is continous on $\Omega$ and $g\vert_{c}=f$

There exist a continous $g$ agree with $f$ outside an arbitary set and $g$ is bounded by $M$ if so does $f$. 

### Littlewood like principle

> Absolutely integrable function almost support on bounded set. Formally, let $f$ integrable and $\epsilon>0$, there exist a ball $B(0,R)$ s.t.
> $$ \int_{B^c(0,R)} |f|\le \epsilon $$

**Proof** Note

$$ \int |f|=\int_{B(0,R)}|f|+\int_{B^c(0,R)} |f|=\int_{}|f\chi_{B(0,R)}|+\int_{B^c(0,R)} |f| $$

and $g_n=|f\chi_{B(0,R)}|$ is increasing to $g=|f|$ and by MCT

$$\lim_{R\to\infty} \int_{}|f\chi_{B(0,R)}|=\int|f| $$

hence the claim follows for suffictently large $R$. $\blacksquare$

> Measurable function almost locally bounded. Let $f$ support on a finite measure set $E$ and $\epsilon>0$, there exist a measurable subset $A$ s.t. $m(A)\le \epsilon$ and $f$ is locally bounded outside $A$. That is, for every $R>0$, there exist $M<\infty$ s.t. $|f|\le M$ for all $x\in B(0,R)-A$
> 

**Proof** A measurable function is nearly continuous by lusin's theorem and finite measurable set is almost compact. Then this claim follows from continuous function attain maxima on a compact set.


**Remark** If $f$ is integrable, then $f$ is bounded outside $A$.

<!-- **Remark** The difference of their integral is also arbitary small. To estabish this, suppose $f$ is non negative.

$$ \int_{A_n^c} f=\int f\chi_{A_n^c}$$

where $f\chi_{A_n^c}\nearrow f$ and thus

$$ \int f-\int f\chi_{A_n^c} $$ 

can be arbitary small. If $f$ is genral:

$$ \int f=\int f^+-f^- $$

there exist $N_1,N_2$ s.t. for all $n>\max(N_1,N_2)$

$$ \begin{aligned}
    \int f^+-\int f^+\chi_{A^c_{n}}&<2\epsilon
    \\
    0<\int f^--\int f^-\chi_{A^c_{n}}&<\epsilon
\end{aligned} $$

thus

$$ \int f - \int f\chi _{A_n^c}<\epsilon  $$ -->


Lusin's theorem is equivalent to Littlewood's second principle. To estabish this, note integrable function is almost bounded. Then it's sufficient to show when $f$ is bounded. Suppose $|f|\le M$, by the remark above, there exist continous $g$ and $g=f$ outside an arbitary set $A$, then

$$ \int |g-f|=\int_A |g-f|\le 2Mm(A)\le 2M\epsilon $$

note integrable functions almost have bounded support, we may restric $g$ again and finished. $\blacksquare$



##  Littlewood's third principle

Recall that a sequence $f_n$ may converge to $f$:

1. (**Pointwise convergence**) $f_n\to f$ everywhere.

2. (**Pointwise a.e.**) $f_n \to f$ a.e.

3. (**Uniformly convergence**) $\forall \epsilon>0,x\in \mathbb{R^d}$, there exist $N$ s.t. $d(f_n(x),f(x))<\epsilon$ forall $n\ge N$.

Then we introduce **locally** uniform convergence. A sequence $f_n$ converge locally uniformly to $f$ if it's converges uniformly in every bounded subset $E\in \mathbb{R^d}$. By the compactness of reals, we have

> $f_n\to f$ locally uniformly iff $\forall x\in \mathbb{R^d}$, there exist a open neighborhood $G$ s.t. $f_n \to f$ uniformly in $G$.

**Proof** $\implies$ is immediately by taking $B(x,R)$ for any $R$. For $\impliedby$, consider any bounded $E$, by definition, there exist some $B(0,R)\supset E$, then we take its closure $\overline{B(0,R)}$, which is still bounded and thus compact. For any point $x\in \overline{B(0,R)}$, we may find an open set $G_x$ contains $x$ and on which $f_n \to f$ uniformly. Then we have a open cover:

$$ \bigcup_{x\in \overline{B(0,R)}} G_x\supset \overline{B(0,R)} $$

By Heine-Borel, we may take some finite $I=\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n\}$, and 

$$ \bigcup_{x\in I} G_x\supset \overline{B(0,R)} $$

Note that if $f_n\to f$ uniformly for every $G_x$, it's also converges uniformly in their finite union. Then the results follows from $E\subset \overline{B(0,R)}$. $\blacksquare$

One can recover local uniform by ignoring a small set:

> **(Egorov's theorem)** Suppose $f_n \to f$ a.e., for any m $\epsilon>0$, there exist a $A$ of measure at most $\epsilon$ s.t. $f_n\to f$ locally uniformly outside $A$.

**Proof** Since We may take the zero measure set into $A$, we may assume $f_n \to f$ everywhere. Consider

$$ E_{N,m}=\{x:|f_n(x)-f(x)|>1/m \text{ for some } n\ge N\} $$

It's clearly decreasing with $N$ and

$$ \bigcap_{N=0}^\infty E_{N,m}=\emptyset $$

thus we have

$$ \lim_{N\to \infty} m(E_{N,m}\cap B(0,R))=0 $$

By the definition of limit, we may find $N_m$ s.t for all $N\ge N_m$.

$$ m(E_{N,m}\cap B(0,m))\le \frac{\epsilon}{2^m} $$

Then let

$$ A=\bigcup_{m=1}^{\infty} E_{N_m,m}\cap B(0,m) $$

Where $m(A)\le \epsilon$. Note if $x\in  B(0,m)-E_{N,m}^c$, $|f_n(x)-f(x)|\le 1/m$. For any $m_0\in \mathbb{N^+}$

$$\begin{aligned}
    B(0,m_0)-A&=B(0,m_0)\cap A^c
    \\&=\bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty}( E_{N_m,m}^c\cup B^c(0,m))\cap B(0,m_0)
    \\&=\bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty}( E_{N_m,m}^c\cap B(0,m_0))\cup( B^c(0,m)\cap B(0,m_0))
\end{aligned} $$

When $m \ge m_0$, $B^c(0,m)\cap B(0,m_0)=\emptyset$. Hence we can always find $\frac{1}{m}<\varepsilon$ and for $n\ge N_m$
$, |f_n(x)-f(x)|\le \varepsilon$ for any $x\in B(0,m_0)-A$. Note every bounded subset $E\subset B(0,m)$ for some $m$ and hence $f_n \to f$ locally uniformly. $\blacksquare$

**Remark** If all $f_n$ and $f$ support on a fixed $E$ with finite measure, then $f_n \to f$ uniformly not only locally from the above argument.(Since finite masure set is almost compact and thus there exist $B(0,m)\supset E$)
