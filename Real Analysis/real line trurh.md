# Some useful results in real lines

Suppose closed set $K\subset \Reals$ and $K\subset I$ where $I$ is some finite interval. Then $K$ is compact.

Suppose open set $G\subset \Reals$, then

1. $G$ can be written as countable union of disjoint open intervals.

Suppose $A$ is a Lebesgue measurbale set

1. $\forall \epsilon\lt 0,\exists A\subset G \ni m(G-A)\lt \epsilon$. 
2. $\forall \epsilon\lt 0,\exists F\subset A \ni m(A-F)\lt \epsilon$.
3. There exist a $G_\delta\supset A$ which is countable intersection of a decreasing sequence of open sets and $m(G_\delta-A)=0$
4. There exist a $F_\sigma\supset A$ which is countable union of a increasing sequence of closed sets and $m(A-F_\sigma)=0$
