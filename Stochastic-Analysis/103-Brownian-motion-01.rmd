## Scaled Symmetric Random Walk

Note that we let $M_k=\sum_{i=1}^{k}X_i$, and then we defined the scaled symmetric random walk:

$$
W^{(n)}(t)=\frac{1}{n}M_{nt}
$$

where $nt\in \mathbb{N}$.

For $0\le s\le t$, we have

$$
W^{(n)}(t)=\left( W^{n}(t)-W^{n}(s) \right) + W^{n}(s)
$$

from this equation, we find that the scaled symmetric random walk is a martingale.


::: {.theorem  name="central limit"}

Fix $t\ge 0$, as $n\to \infty$, the distribution of the scaled random walk $W^{n}(t)$ evaluated at time $t$ converges to the normal distribution with mean zero and variance $t$.

As $n\to \infty$, the distribution of $S_n(t)$ where

$$
S_n(t) = S(0)u_n^{H_{nt}}d_n^{T_{nt}}
$$

and $u_n=1+\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ with $d_n=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
