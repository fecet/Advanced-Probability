## Martingale Transformation

### Doob's decomposition

::: {.definition  name=""}

A process $\left\{ X_{t} \right\}_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$ is said to be $\mathbb{F}$-predictable if $X_0 \in \mathcal{F}_0$ and $X_{n+1}\in \mathcal{F}_{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

:::

### Previsible process

A process $X=\left\{ X_t \right\}_{t\in \mathbb{N^+}}$ is previsible if $X_n$ is $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ measurable.

Think of $C_n$ as your sake on game $n$, and you have some strategy based on history up to $n-1$ to determine value of it, that make $C_n$ previsible. Now the total winning at $n$ is

$$
Y_n=\sum_{1\le i\le n}^{}C_i(X_i-X_{i-1}) =: (C X)_{n}
$$
$CX$ is the martingale transform of $X$ by $C$, which is the discrete analogue of stochastic integral $\int C dX$.

If $X$ isn't a fair game, you cannot beat it by some smart strategy:


::: {.proposition  name="You can't beat the system"}

Let $C$ be a bounded non-negative previsible process, $X$ be a supermartingale, $CX$ is a supermartingale null at $0$. 

If $X$ is martingale, $CX$ is martingale if $C$ is bounded.

### Stopped supermartingale

Let $X$ be a supermartingale, with previous setting, we have process $C$ and $Y$, but we stop $C$ at time $\tau$ and stake $1$ each game. Now the winnings is:
$$
Y_n=X_{\tau \land n}-X_0
$$
Here we use $X^{T}$ to present process $\left\{ X^{T}_{n}=X_{\tau \land  n} \right\}$, then it's a supermartingale if so is $X$. Thus if $X$ is a martingale, we have $\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_{\tau \land n}=\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_0$.

### Doob's Optional-Stopping Theorem


::: {.theorem  name=""}

Let $\tau$ be a stopping time, let $X$ be a supermartingale. Then $X_\tau$ is integral and $\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_{\tau}\le \mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_0$ if one of flowing holds:

1.  $\tau$ is bounded.
2.  $X$ is bounded and $\tau$ is $a.s.$ bounded.
3.  $\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}\tau<\infty$ and $\left| X_n-X_{n-1} \right|$ is bounded for any $n$.

:::

Apply this to both $X$ and $-X$, we have $\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_{\tau}=\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_0$ and $X$ is integral under the same situations.


::: {.corollary  name=""}

Suppose $X$ is a martingale with increments $X_{n}-X_{n-1}$ is bounded and $C$ is bounded previsible processes, $\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}\tau<\infty$, then
$$
\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}(CX)_{\tau}=0
$$

:::

::: {.corollary  name=""}

If $X\ge 0$ is supermartingale and $\tau$ is $a.s.$ finite, then $\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_{\tau}\le \mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_0$.

:::

:::: {.proof}
$$
\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_{\tau}=\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}\liminf_n X_{\tau \land n}\le \liminf_n \mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_{\tau \land n} \le \mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}X_0
$$

### Awaiting the almost inevitable


::: {.lemma  name=""}

Suppose that $\tau$ is a stopping time $s.t.$ for some $N\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varepsilon>0$, we have $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$:
$$
\mathop{{}\mathbb{P}}_{\mathcal{F}_n}(\tau\le n+N)>\varepsilon
$$
$a.s.$, then $\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}_{}\tau<\infty$.
